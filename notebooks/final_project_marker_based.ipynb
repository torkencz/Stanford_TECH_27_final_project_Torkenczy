        "#### **Problem statement**:\n",
        "In the past 10 years a new frontier of genetics has opened up with single-cell RNA sequencing. Predating these technologies we were able to measure genetic material in bulk, which has resulted in averaged readouts from heterogeneous tissues. With improvements in microfluidic technologies we are now able to measure RNA, and DNA in individual cells within tissues which can reveal answers to complex questions regarding healthy tissues and disease.Of all of the single-cell techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing is the most widely used. In microfluidic devices individual cells are isolated, and RNA molecules are isolated with a matched identifier for the cell. On the computational side RNA molecule sequences (reads) are aligned to the genome (in this case human). Finally, per gene reads are quantified per cell, resulting in a raw counts matrix (gene x cells). These are very 0 inflated (~10% of values in the counts matrix contain non zero values). This necessitates feature selection, followed by PCA, clustering, and finally UMAP to identify structure within the data. One of the active questions currently within this field is how to identify the cell type of each cell. This is usually done via hand annotation by taking gene sets that are \"markers\" for a cell type. This is a lot of work, so machine learnin, especially transfer learnin has been applied to transfer annotations from reference datasets to novel ones. I decided to try some of what we learnt on this classification problem. The golden standard dataset for single cell RNA comes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These are easy dissassociated cells from the blood, and therefore have gone through extensive analysis. \n",

        "#### **Objective**:\n",
        " \n",
        " Comprehensive machine learning pipeline for automated cell type identification in PBMC single-cell RNA sequencing data using marker-based annotation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Methodology**:\n",
        "\n",
        "The machine learning pipeline employs a marker-based cell type annotation approach, followed by supervised learning for automated cell classification. The methodology consists of four integrated stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "For single-cell data two major software packages exist for analysis: scanpy (in python) and Seurat (in R). Both methods follow the same logic in terms of analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Download three PBMC datasets from 10x Genomics representing different single-cell technologies\n",
        "- Extract and standardize data formats (matrix.mtx, features.tsv, barcodes.tsv)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Preprocessing and quality control**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quality Control**: Calculate QC metrics (number of detected genes/cell, total read counts/cell, percentage of mitochondrial genes).\n",
        "- **Filtering**: Apply standard filters and show statistics. This is usually dataset dependent. First you want to remove lowly expressed genes (<200 reads aligned), then you remove cells with low number of reads (<500 reads per cell>). Finally you remove cells with high mitochondrial content, which usually indicates that a cell has died (<20% mitochondrial gene).\n",
        "- **Normalization**: Normalize to sequencing depth followed by multiplying by a fixed number (e.g.: 10k), and log-transform. This is standard procedure as:\n",
        "    - Each cell in a single-cell experiment can have vastly different sequencing depths (total reads or UMIs), often due to capture efficiency, amplification, or sequencing variation. Without normalization, a cell with twice the sequencing depth would appear to express every gene at twice the level, even if biology is identical. \n",
        "    - Gene expression counts have a highly skewed distribution: a few genes are expressed at very high levels, while most are low or zero. Downstream statistical methods (PCA, clustering) work better when variance is more symmetric and large values are compressed. Log transformation also helps stabilize variance for high-count genes. Commonly log1p(x) = log(1 + x) is used.\n",
        "- **Feature Selection**: Find highly variable genes. \n",
        "    - The variance and mean expression of genes (which is correlated) is modeled and then above than normal genes are selected. \n",
        "- **Data scaling**: Z-score standardization with maximum value clipping\n",
        "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA and UMAP visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Marker-Based Cell Type Annotation**\n",
        "We use a simple **clustering-based annotation pipeline** that :\n",

        "- **Automated marker gene enrichment scoring** against known cell type signatures\n",
        "- **Quality-controlled cell type assignment** with confidence scoring\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Machine Learning Pipeline**\n",
        "- **Dimensionality reduction**: Apply PCA (50 components) to capture ~20-60% of biological variance based on the union of highly variable genes from all of the studied datasets. Different datasets are projected into the same PCA space. This is done due to the highly 0 inflated and noisy data from single cell datasets.\n",
